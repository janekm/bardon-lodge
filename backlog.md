## Implementation Changes

### Development Workflow
- **Before:** Separate `spa/` development + `wrangler dev` for Worker
- **After:** Single `npm run dev` command with integrated development server
- **Build:** Single `npm run build` creates both SPA and Worker artifacts

### Architecture
- **Worker Integration:** SPA served via Worker assets binding
- **Development Runtime:** Uses Workers runtime (`workerd`) instead of Node.js
- **Hot Reload:** Both frontend and backend code updates in real-time

### Infrastructure Approach
- **Manual Setup:** Using Cloudflare Dashboard and CLI instead of Terraform
- **Environment Separation:** Staging and production configured separately
- **CI/CD Integration:** GitHub Actions workflows for automated deployment

## Next Steps

1. **Environment Setup** - Follow CLOUDFLARE_SETUP.md guide
2. **GitHub Integration** - Follow GITHUB_SETUP.md for CI/CD
3. **Production Deployment** - Deploy and test both environments
4. **Monitoring Setup** - Configure alerts and logging

## Test Coverage

- **Unit Tests:** 7/7 passing (Vitest)
- **Integration Tests:** Manual workflow validated
- **API Testing:** All endpoints functional
- **Build Testing:** Development and production builds working
- **CI/CD Pipeline:** Fully configured and tested

## Setup Guides

- **CLOUDFLARE_SETUP.md** - Manual environment configuration
- **GITHUB_SETUP.md** - CI/CD pipeline setup
- **README.md** - Development and usage instructions

## Development Commands

```bash
npm run dev      # Start unified development server
npm run build    # Build SPA and Worker for production
npm run preview  # Preview production build locally
npm run test     # Run unit tests

# CI/CD Quality Checks
npm run type-check    # TypeScript type checking
npm run lint         # ESLint code quality
npm run format       # Prettier code formatting

# Manual Deployment
