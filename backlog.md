## Implementation Changes

### Development Workflow

- **Before:** Separate `spa/` development + `wrangler dev` for Worker
- **After:** Single `npm run dev` command with integrated development server
- **Build:** Single `npm run build` creates both SPA and Worker artifacts

### Architecture

- **Worker Integration:** SPA served via Worker assets binding
- **Development Runtime:** Uses Workers runtime (`workerd`) instead of Node.js
- **Hot Reload:** Both frontend and backend code updates in real-time

## Next Steps

1. **CI/CD Implementation** - GitHub Actions workflow
2. **Production Deployment** - End-to-end testing and go-live
3. **Custom Domain** - Production domain configuration
4. **Monitoring** - Error tracking and performance monitoring

## Test Coverage

- **Unit Tests:** 7/7 passing (Vitest)
- **Integration Tests:** Manual workflow validated
- **API Testing:** All endpoints functional
- **Build Testing:** Development and production builds working

## Development Commands

```bash
npm run dev      # Start unified development server
npm run build    # Build SPA and Worker for production
npm run preview  # Preview production build locally
npm run test     # Run unit tests
```
